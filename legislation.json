Point 145.A.35(d) requires such a training to keep certifying staff and support staff updated in terms of relevant technology, procedures, safety management and human factors issues which means it is one part of ensuring compliance. Therefore, sufficient duration should be related to relevant audit findings and other internal / external sources of information available to the organisation on human errors and safety issues in maintenance. This means that in the case of an organisation that maintains aircraft with limited relevant audit findings, hazards and related safety risks identified, recurrent training could be limited to days rather than weeks, whereas in the case of a similar organisation with a number of relevant audit findings, hazards and related safety risks identified, such a training may take several weeks. For an organisation that maintains aircraft components, the duration of recurrent training would follow the same philosophy but should be scaled down to reflect the more limited nature of the activity. For example, certifying staff who release hydraulic pumps may only require a few hours of recurrent training, whereas those who release turbine engines may only require a few days of such a training. The content of recurrent training should be related to relevant audit findings, hazards and related safety risks identified. It is recommended that such training is reviewed at least once in every 24-month period.",

The alternative solution is to use existing rotable tags and also supply a copy of the certificate. A certificate should not be issued for any item when it is known that the item is unserviceable except in the case of an item undergoing a series of maintenance processes at several maintenance organisations approved under Part-145 and the item needs a certificate for the previous maintenance process carried out for the next maintenance organisation approved under Part-145 to accept the item for subsequent maintenance processes. In such a case, a clear statement of limitation should be endorsed in Block 12.",

    "text": "Safety management seeks to proactively identify hazards and to mitigate the related safety risks before they result in aviation accidents and incidents. Safety management enables an organisation to manage its activities in a more systematic and focused manner. When an organisation has a clear understanding of its role and contribution to aviation safety, it can prioritise safety risks and more effectively manage their resources and obtain optimal results. The principles of the requirements in points 145.A.200, 145.A.202, 145.A.205 and the related AMC constitute the EU management system framework for aviation safety management. This framework addresses the core elements of the ICAO safety management system (SMS) framework defined in Appendix 2 to Annex 19, includes the elements of the compliance monitoring system, and promotes an integrated approach to the management of an organisation. It facilitates the introduction of the additional safety management components, building upon the existing management system, rather than adding them as a separate framework. This approach is intended to encourage organisations to embed safety management and risk-based decision-making into all their activities, instead of superimposing another system onto their existing management system and governance structure. In addition, if the organisation holds multiple organisation certificates within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, it may choose to implement a single management system to cover all of its activities. An integrated management system may not only be used to capture management system requirements resulting from Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, but also could cover other regulatory frameworks requiring compliance with Annex 19 or other business management systems such as security, occupational health and environmental management systems. Integration will remove any duplication and exploit synergies by managing safety risks across multiple activities. Organisations may determine the best means to structure their management systems to suit their business and organisational needs.",

Most aviation safety regulations constitute generic safety risk controls established by the ‘regulator’. Therefore, ensuring effective compliance with the regulations during daily operations and independent monitoring of compliance are fundamental to any management system for safety. The compliance monitoring function may, in addition, support the follow-up of safety risk mitigation actions. Moreover, where non-compliances are identified through internal audits, the causes will be thoroughly assessed and analysed. Such an analysis in return supports the risk management process by providing insights into causal and contributing factors, including human factors, organisational factors and the environment in which the organisation operates. In this way, the outputs of compliance monitoring become some of the various inputs to the safety risk management functions. Conversely, the output of the safety risk management processes may be used to determine focus areas for compliance monitoring. In this way, internal audits will inform the organisation’s management of the level of compliance within the organisation, whether safety risk mitigation actions have been implemented, and where corrective or preventive action is required. The combination of safety risk management and compliance monitoring should lead to an enhanced understanding of the end-to-end process and the process interfaces, exposing opportunities for increased efficiencies, which are not limited to safety aspects.",

The organisation and the way in which it operates can have a significant impact on human performance. Therefore, safety management necessarily addresses how humans can contribute both positively and negatively to an organisation’s safety outcomes, recognising that human behaviour is influenced by the organisational environment. The effectiveness of safety management largely depends on the degree of commitment of the senior management to create a working environment that optimises human performance and encourages personnel to actively engage in and contribute to the organisation’s management processes. Similarly, a positive safety culture relies on a high degree of trust and respect between the personnel and the management, and it must therefore be created and supported at the senior management level. If the management does not treat individuals who identify hazards and report adverse events in a consistently fair and just way, those individuals are unlikely to be willing to communicate safety issues or to work with the management to effectively address the safety risks. As with trust, a positive safety culture takes time and effort to establish, and it can be easily lost.",

Over time, an effective management system will not only address the risks of major occurrences, but also identify and address production inefficiencies, improve communication, foster a better organisational culture, and lead to a more effective control of contractors and suppliers. In addition, through an improved relationship with the authority, an effective management system may result in a reduced oversight burden. Thus, by viewing safety management and the related organisational policies and key processes as items that are implemented not only to prevent incidents and accidents, but also to meet the organisation’s strategic objectives, any investment in safety should be seen as an investment in productivity and organisational success.",
