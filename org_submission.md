_Serviceable Components_

Serviceable comp[onents shall be accompanied by
NOTE: A document equivalent to an EASA Form 1 may be:

    - a release document issued by an organisation under the terms of a bilateral
agreement signed by the European Community;

    - a release document issued by an organisation approved under the terms of a JAA
bilateral agreement until superseded by the corresponding agreement signed by
the European Community;

    a JAA Form One issued prior to 28 November 2004 by a JAR 145 organisation
approved by a JAA Full Member State;

    - in the case of new aircraft components that were released from manufacturing prior
to the Part-21 compliance date the component should be accompanied by a JAA
Form One issued by a JAR 21 organisation approved by a JAA Full Member
Authority and within the JAA mutual recognition system;

    a JAA Form One issued prior to 28 September 2005 by a production organisation
approved by a competent authority in accordance with its national regulations.

_Unserviceable Components_

Organization does not hold any component maintenance approvals.

_Unsalvageable Components_

Unsalvageable components removed from aircraft on maintenance shall be
accompanied by an appropriate SCRAP tag and entered into the stores QUARANTINE
register.

_Standard Parts_


Standard parts are parts manufactured in complete compliance with an established
industry, Agency, competent authority or other Government specification, which
includes design, manufacturing, test and acceptance criteria, and uniform identification
requirements.

The specification should include all information necessary to produce and verify
conformity of the part. It should be published so that any party may manufacture the
part. Examples of specifications are National Aerospace Standards (NAS), Army-Navy
Aeronautical Standard (AN), Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), SAE Sematec,
Joint Electron Device Engineering Council, Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council,
and American National Standards Institute (ANSI), EN Specifications etc…

To designate a part as a standard part the type certificate holder may issue a standard
parts manual accepted by the competent authority of original type certificate holder or


|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCEORGANISATION EXPOSITION|Ref:|AXJS/145/MOE|
|---|---|---|---|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE ORGANISATION EXPOSITION|Issue/Amdt:|3 / 3|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Page:|2.7|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Date:|05 Oct 17|



may make reference in the parts catalogue to a national/international specification
(such as a standard diode/capacitor etc.) not being an aviation only specification for
the particular part.

Items purchased in batches (fasteners etc.) should be supplied intact in the original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) in a package. The packaging should state the
applicable specification/standard, P/N, batch number and the quantity specified in the
package of the items. The documentation accompanying the material should contain
the applicable specification/standard, P/N, lot batch number, and the supplied quantity,
and the manufacturing sources. If the material is acquired from different lots batches,
acceptance documentation for each lot batch should be supplied.

Some material is subject to special conditions such as storage condition or life limitation
etc. and this should be included on the documentation and / or material packaging. Life
limits such as shelf life expiry dates for seals shall be entered into the goods receipt
register as well as being clearly marked on the external packaging.

_Material_


Consumable material is any material which is only used once, such as lubricants,
cements, compounds, paints, chemicals dyes and sealants etc.

Raw material is any material that requires further work to make it into a component part
of the aircraft such as metals, plastics, wood, fabric etc.

Material both raw and consumable should only be accepted when satisfied that it is to
the required specification. To be satisfied, the material and or its packaging should be
marked with the specification and where appropriate the batch number.

Documentation accompanying all material should clearly relate to the particular
material and contain a conformity statement plus both the manufacturing and supplier
source. Some material is subject to special conditions such as storage condition or life
limitation etc. and this should be included on the documentation and / or material
packaging. Life limits such as shelf life expiry dates for seals shall be entered into the
goods receipt register as well as being clearly marked on the external packaging. EASA
Form 1 or equivalent is not normally issued for such material and therefore none should
be expected. The material specification is normally identified in the type certificates
holder’s data.

Quarantine Procedure


Items that cannot satisfy the applicable goods receipt inspection requirements shall be
held in the secure quarantine store until the discrepancy is resolved to the satisfaction
of the certifying staff. Items placed in the quarantine store shall be identified with a
quarantine label and entered in the quarantine register, stating relevant details and the
reason for rejection. Only the Quality Manager or certifying staff may remove items
from the quarantine store, recording the action in the quarantine register to provide a
full record.

|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Page:|2.8|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Date:|05 Oct 17|



Modification Standard and AD Compliance


The EASA Form 1 or equivalent identifies the status of an aircraft component. Block 12
‘Remarks’ on the EASA Form 1 shall be checked by the certifying staff as in some
cases it contains vital airworthiness related information that may need appropriate and
necessary actions. The Organization shall be satisfied that the component in question
is in satisfactory condition and has been appropriately released to service. In addition,
the organization should ensure that the component meets the approved data/standard,
such as the required design and modification standard. This may be accomplished by
reference to the manufacturer’s parts catalogue or other approved data (i.e. Service
Bulletin). Care should also be taken in ensuring compliance with applicable
airworthiness directives, the status of any life-limited parts fitted to the aircraft
component as well as Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations.

Identification of Storage Limitations / Life Limits

Items that are subject to storage limitations / life limits i.e. shelf life, shall have that life
clearly marked on the packaging and entered into the goods receipt record.

**2.2.4 Acceptance and Incoming Inspection of Components from Internal Sources**


Not applicable as no component maintenance approvals are held by the Organization.

**2.2.5 Acceptance and Incoming Inspection of Internal Fabricated Parts in accordance**

**with Part 145.A.42 (c)**


Not applicable as the Organization is not approved for the fabrication of parts as
detailed in Part 145.A.42 (c).

**2.2.6 Components Removed Serviceable from Aircraft**


If a requirement arises from an operator to remove a serviceable component from an
aircraft, the component shall be labelled with a serviceable label stating the donor
aircraft and hours and landings at removal. The item shall be appropriately protected
and packed to await disposal instructions from the operator.

**2.2.7 Procedure for Treatment of a Suspected Unapproved (Bogus) Part**


Reference CAP 562 Leaflet B-1-130 unapproved parts include, but are not limited to:

a) Parts specified in the illustrated parts catalogues (IPC) of a type certificated aircraft, but

which have been manufactured, reclaimed or reworked and then marked by an
unauthorised source and provided with documents which indicate falsely that the part(s) are
genuine and conform to the approved type design, or meet a particular industry standard
and are offered for use as conforming with an aircraft manufacturer's authorised IPC.


b) Parts shipped directly to users by manufacturers, suppliers, or distributors who do not

themselves hold appropriate production approvals for the parts, and have not been
authorised to make direct shipments to users or stockists by the Type Certificate holder,

**2.3.1 Procedures for Maintaining Satisfactory Storage Conditions (including**

**segregation).**


General

Aircraft components and materials will be stored in the designated stores area as
defined in section 1.8 of this Exposition, in accordance with the storage conditions and
limitations defined by the manufacturer. In the absence of any specific instructions the
guidance laid down in CAP 562 Leaflet D-40, Storage Conditions for Aeronautical
Supplies shall be applied.

Routable Components

Routable components are stores in their receiving packaging until required for use.
Blanks, plugs and protective covers are to remain installed until fitment to the aircraft.
The component shall be stored so as to prevent damage or contamination from other
components in close proximity, e.g. oxygen components shall be stored remotely from
components containing oil or grease.

Perishables, Raw Materials


Perishable items and material are stored in designated areas in accordance with the
general conditions stated above.


Flammable Fluids

Flammable fluids are stored in a special storage cabinet that meets or exceeds
HSG51, 1990 guidelines.

Engines

Engines may be stored in the hangar due to their size. They shall remain in their STC
packaging until required for use.

Bulky Assemblies


Bulky assemblies may be stored in the hangar due to their size. They shall remain in
their STC packaging until required for use.

Record of Position in Stores

Due to the small size of the store a shelf numbering system is not utilised. Items
preloaded for an aircraft input are placed on a particular shelf and a temporary label
with the registration affixed.

|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Page:|2.11|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Date:|05 Oct 17|



**2.3.2 System and Procedure to Control Shelf Life / Life Limits and Modification**

**Standard**


Items that are subject to storage limitations / life limits i.e. shelf life, shall have that life
clearly marked on the packaging and entered into the goods receipt record. On a
monthly basis a check of items subject to a shelf life is carried out by the Maintenance
Manager. Items which will expire during the next month will be removed from the store
prior to or on their expiration date. The products will be discarded immediately (minor
items) or they will be identified as expired and placed into quarantine waiting for final
disposition.

The organization has no special requirement to control items subject to a life limit as all
such records remain the responsibility of the operator.

The organization has no special requirements to control items that have a specific
modification standard as all such records remain the responsibility of the operator.

**2.3.3 Special Storage Requirements (condition and limitation)**


The conditions specified in section 2.3.1 General of this Exposition shall be applied for
items such as rubber (tyres), sheet rubber, sheet metal etc.

If possible ESD sensitive items shall remain in their special packaging during the
incoming inspection process. If it is required to remove them from this packaging, staff
shall wear an earth strap and place the item on the static mat in stores prior to disturbing
the packaging. Storage of ESD sensitive devices shall be on a specially designated
shelf which is earthed.

**2.3.4 Tagging / Labelling System and Storage Areas**


Parts and materials meeting the criteria of full compliance with the Purchase Order are
identified with a serviceable label bearing a unique batch number and placed in the
stores or, should the occasion demand, will be issued to the certifying staff for
immediate use.


Parts and materials not in compliance with the Purchase Order, Certification
Requirement or that fail Goods Inwards Inspection will have a quarantine label attached
and then placed in the Quarantine Store pending further qualification or return to
sender.


All parts removed from aircraft, will be identified by tagging, as serviceable or
unserviceable.


Segregation of serviceable parts from unserviceable parts is achieved by placing any
unserviceable items in a designated stores area.


Components or parts sent for repair/overhaul/calibration are referenced in the
Purchase Order file prior to dispatch. Each component or part will have a fully
completed unserviceable label attached.

**2.15 RECTIFICATION OF DEFECTS ARISING DURING BASE MAINTENANCE**

**2.15.1 Base Maintenance Procedure**


Records of Base Maintenance Defects


The B1/B2 support staff (or for aircraft other than large aircraft; appropriate aircraft type
rated certifying staff qualified as B1 and B2 in accordance with Part 66 and Part
145.A.35) performing the inspection or task will list aircraft defects found during base
maintenance on a work sheet at the time of discovery. They will assess the work, time
scale and whether the rectification is within the capability of the Organization. If the
work is found to be within the capability of the Organization and is able to be completed
within the time allocated for the base maintenance input, they will organise the
rectification to be carried out at this time. If the work required is either considered to be
too large to be carried out at this time or beyond the capability of the Organization, the
owner / operator will be contacted for a decision to either extend the downtime, carry
forward the defect to a future maintenance input, contract in a specialised approved
organization or send the aircraft to a contracted maintenance facility for rectification.


NOTE: Defects that affect the airworthiness of the aeroplane must be rectified prior to
a certificate of release to service being certified.

Sign Off of Base Maintenance Defects

All base maintenance defects will be signed for by B1/B2 support staff (or for aircraft
other than large aircraft; appropriate aircraft type rated certifying staff qualified as B1
and B2 in accordance with Part 66 and Part 145.A.35).


The completed work sheets will form part work pack as detailed in section 2.13.5 of this
Exposition and submitted to the base maintenance certifying staff for the Part 145.A.50
release to service certification.

**2.15.2 Analysis of Defects and Rectification**


As part of the normal base maintenance defect rectification procedure, the
Organization will analyse defects found and rectifications carried out and if in the
opinion of the Organization, those defects and / or rectifications could affect the
airworthiness of the aircraft and / or have implications that could affect the approved
maintenance programme, the Maintenance Manager will notify the owner / operator.

A certificate of release to service shall be issued by appropriately authorised certifying
staff on behalf of the Organization when it has been verified that all maintenance
ordered has been properly carried out by the Organization in accordance with the
procedures in this Exposition and using the appropriately approved maintenance data
and there are no non-compliances which are known to endanger flight safety.

A certificate of release to service shall be issued before flight at the completion of any
maintenance. The certificate of release to service statement shall be as follows:

**“Certifies that the work specified except as otherwise specified was carried out**
**in accordance with Part 145 and in respect to that work the aircraft/aircraft**
**component is considered ready for release to service.”**

The Part 145.A.50 Certificate of Release to Service for completed maintenance is a
certification for completion of the programmed work package, together with additional
work arising. This certification is a declaration of satisfactory work clearance in each
applicable category, signifying that all work required has been actioned. This permits
the aircraft to be released to service. The certifying staff must ensure that all appropriate
certifications have been duly completed prior to releasing the aircraft to service.

It follows that if incidents or maintenance malpractice arise from completion of a defined
work task, which necessitates investigations and possible disciplinary action in respect
of an individual, such action shall be limited to the responsibility discharged by that
individual. Occurrences arising from failure of management systems or services
supporting the individual become subject to separate and wider investigation,
particularly where they could jeopardise the Organization’s Part 145 approval.

The following regulation shall apply when performing certification actions:


    - All work will be carried out in accordance with and cross referenced to data
approved or accepted by the Authority or by an organisation approved or accepted
by the Authority.

    - All items used in the maintenance activity must have been released to the
requirements of the Authority and as detailed in section 2.2 of this Exposition.

    All Parts must be traceable by the GRN, which must be recorded on the
maintenance document.

    - Under no circumstances may an item affecting safety of flight be carried forward.

    - No fabricated Parts may be made to pattern; reference must be made to the
approved data.

    - The application of a certifying staff signature, authorization number and date of an
authorised engineer in the certification block on any maintenance document, for an


|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCEORGANISATION EXPOSITION|Ref:|AXJS/145/MOE|

|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Date:|05 Oct 17|



aircraft or aircraft component, is an authorization that the work detailed has been
carried out to approved data and in accordance with the procedures in this
Exposition. Each person completing and certifying any work activity is therefore
accountable by legalisation for the adequacy of the task performed against defined
standards.

- Part 145 require that a certificate of release to service shall be issued by
appropriately qualified and authorised persons as an indication that the work has
been completed to an airworthiness standard. A certifying signature and stamp in
the certification block on the appropriate maintenance documentation provides this
requirement.

- In signing for any work completed to an airworthiness standard, an authorised
person contributes to the issue of the Part 145.A.50 Certificate of Release to
Service by another authorised person. This system accepting both individual and
collective responsibility provides that the airworthiness assurances required in Part
145 are met.

- All work shall be completed to a standard suitable for the issue of a certificate of
release to service. Signing for items shall be interpreted to this effect.

- All work tasks performed shall be completed in accordance with authorised data,
by authorised methods, using approved materials, and recommended tooling and,
where applicable, test equipment which is currently calibrated and shall be signed
for by authorised persons and certified by appropriately authorised certifying staff.

- When extracts from approved data are not provided with the work cards, the
persons signing for the work are responsible for ensuring that the requirements in
the current approved data are satisfied. They must also review any appropriate
temporary revisions and ensure that any relevant requirements are satisfied.

- When extracts from approved data are indicated on the work cards, the persons
certifying the work are responsible for ensuring that the requirements contained in
the extracts are satisfied. This includes requirements specified in other sections of
the approved data; other sources of approved data or diagrams referred to in the
extracts. They must comply with any temporary revisions highlighted in the extracts
and check and comply with any relevant temporary revisions that have been issued
since the extracts were printed.

- All recorded maintenance actions performed shall be appropriate to the recorded
task, maintenance instruction or defect and shall be fully descriptive including
remaining life for lifed components, dimensions, pressures and tolerances and
must refer to the approved data.

- All conditional work arising generated by work sheet tasks e.g. functional checks,
leak checks, duplicate inspections, replacement Part and serial numbers, GRN’s
and/or tag numbers, shall be performed, recorded and signed for as applicable.

- Personnel initiating such requirements or completing the maintenance action
required are responsible for ensuring that these are adequate to restore an aircraft
to an airworthiness standard and provide cross reference to any supplementary
certifications or information.

**2.16.2 Issue of Certificate of Release to Service after Base Maintenance**


The certificate of release to service after base maintenance will only be certified when
the appropriately authorised certifying staff are satisfied that all required maintenance
has been completed and all documentation has been accounted for.

In order to ensure traceability of maintenance documentation, reference shall be made
on each document to the applicable works order number, aircraft registration and type
of scheduled inspection carried out.

Where an aircraft is required to perform a maintenance check flight as part of a base
maintenance task, a certificate of release to service may be certified by appropriately
authorised certifying staff even though all of the maintenance ordered has not been
completed. The certifying staff will assess any open work sheets to ensure that flight
safety is not compromised.

**2.16.3 Issue of Certificate of Release to Service after Line Maintenance**


The certificate of release to service after line maintenance will only be certified when
the appropriately authorised certifying staff are satisfied that all required maintenance
has been completed and all documentation has been accounted for.

In order to ensure traceability of maintenance documentation, reference shall be made
on each document to the applicable works order number, aircraft registration and type
of scheduled inspection or technical log page serial number as required.

Temporary Fit of Components without Appropriate Release Certificate


In the situation when an aircraft is grounded at a location other than Luton due to the
non-availability of a component with the appropriate release certificate, it is permissible
to temporarily fit a component without the appropriate release certificate for a maximum
of 30 flight hours or until the aircraft first returns to an owner / operator designated Part
145 maintenance organization, whichever is the sooner, subject to the aircraft operator
agreement and said component having a suitable release certificate but otherwise in
compliance with all applicable maintenance and operational requirements.

Such components shall be removed by the time limit prescribed above unless an
appropriate release certificate has been obtained in the meantime.

A suitable release certificate means a certificate which clearly states that the aircraft
component is serviceable, that clearly specifies the organisation releasing the said
component together with details of the authority under whose approval the organisation
works including the approval or authorisation reference.

In compliance with all applicable maintenance and operational requirements means
checking for compliance with type design standards, modifications, repairs,
airworthiness directives, life limitations and condition of the aircraft component.

|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Page:|2.43|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Date:|05 Oct 17|



An appropriate entry shall be made in the aircraft technical log including all relevant
details such as where, when and why the aircraft was grounded.

**2.16.4 Issue of Certificate of Release to Service after Defect Rectification (Base / Line)**


The certificate of release to service after defect rectification will only be certified when
the appropriately authorised certifying staff is satisfied that the defect has been rectified
in accordance with approved data and the aircraft is returned to an airworthy condition.

In addition to certifying the defect rectification on the Organization’s work sheet, where
a defect has been entered in the aircraft technical log (incoming defect), a certification
entry clearing that defect shall be made in the aircraft technical log, quoting the action
taken, the approved data and any other relevant information.

**2.16.5 Issue of Certificate Release to Service with Incomplete Work**

In accordance with Part 145.A.50 (e) a certificate of release to service may be issued
when the Organization is unable to complete all maintenance ordered within the
approved aircraft limitations. This fact shall be clearly annotated on the Certificate of
Release to Service before the issue of such certificate.


NOTE: If for whatever reason it is not possible to carry out the complete work
instructions then this must be reported to the aircraft owner / operator who will
determine within the procedural limitation agreed between the owner / operator and
their competent authority the deferment of such incomplete work. Such deferment
must be specified on the certificate of release to service identifying the authority for
such deferment.

When defects are identified during maintenance, such information should be brought
to the attention of the aircraft owner / operator who, dependent upon the procedural
authority granted by the Authority of the state of registry, may determine that some
defects can be deferred. The certificate of release to service must identify the defects
not rectified and specify the owner / operators authority for such action. The aircraft
owner / operator in conjunction with their competent authority will define whether or not
the aircraft can be flown with outstanding maintenance.


The owner / operator may not operate the aircraft other than in accordance with the
MEL for that aircraft. All Deferred Defects must be recorded in the owner / operator’s
aircraft Technical Log and in their Deferred Defects Log.


The one exception to the foregoing paragraph occurs when the defect is considered a
hazard to flight safety. In this case a certificate of release to service is not to be issued
until the defect is rectified. However, if the owner / operator elects to have the defect
rectified elsewhere without the aircraft having to fly, a certificate of release to service
may be issued for the work carried out by the Organization, clearly referencing the
outstanding defect and cross referring to a new work order for the outstanding defect.

**2.16.6 Sign Off after Maintenance Task Completion**


In order to prevent omissions, every maintenance task or group of tasks should be
signed-off. To ensure the task or group of tasks is completed; it should only be signedoff after completion. Work by unauthorised personnel (i.e. temporary staff, trainee)
should be checked by authorised personnel before they sign-off. When formatting work
sheets with multiple stages, the grouping of tasks for the purpose of signing-off shall
allow critical steps to be clearly identified.

Note: A “sign-off” is a statement by the competent person performing or supervising
the work, that the task or group of tasks has been correctly performed. A sign-off relates
to one step in the maintenance process and is therefore different to the release to
service of the aircraft. “Authorised personnel” mean personnel formally authorised by
the Organisation approved under Part 145 to sign-off tasks.

**2.16.7 Cross Reference to Work Packs**


In order to ensure traceability of maintenance documentation, the certificate of release
to service shall include a cross reference to the Organization’s work order number.
When certifying aircraft technical log entries a cross-reference to the maintenance work
sheet and work order number shall be entered in the defect rectification column.

**2.16.8 Issue of EASA Form 1**


An EASA Form 1 may be raised and certified by the Organization for component
maintenance carried out under the terms of its Part 145 approval.
Only those staff that have been approved by the Quality Manager and detailed in
section 1.6.4 of this Exposition may certify an EASA Form 1.

An example of the Organization’s EASA Form 1 is detailed in section 5 of this
Exposition.

**2.16.9 Release of Components Removed Serviceable from Aircraft**

**2.16.10 Issue of a One-Off Certification Authorisation Certificate of Release to Service**


In an unforeseen case, where an aircraft is grounded at a location other than Luton
where no appropriate certifying staff are available, the Organisation may issue a oneoff certification authorisation to:

a) one of its employees holding equivalent type authorisations on aircraft of similar

technology, construction and systems; or


b) any person with not less than five years maintenance experience and holding a

valid ICAO aircraft maintenance licence rated for the aircraft type requiring
certification provided there is no organisation appropriately approved under Part
145 at that location

The Quality Manager shall retain a record of all such authorisations and obtain and
hold on file evidence of the experience and the licence of that person to whom the oneoff authorisation has been granted.


All such cases as specified above shall be reported to the Authority within seven (7)
days of the issuance of such certification authorisation. The Maintenance Manager

**2.18.9 Internal Occurrence Reporting**


The Encouragement of Reporting

The aim of the Organization’s internal occurrence reporting system is to encourage the
free and frank reporting of hazards and risks by not covered by Regulation (EU) No
376/2014 or Regulation (EU) 2015/1018, with the objective of identifying the factors
contributing to those hazards and risks and initiate mitigating actions to reduce the risk
to as low as reasonably practicable.


A **Hazard** is defined as any condition, event, or circumstance which could induce an
accident.


**Risk** is a combination of the likelihood of a hazard occurring and the severity of the
accident that could result; e.g. the higher the risk, the more likely the accident will
occur and/or the more severe will be the consequence


A Code of Practice

The following procedures represent the code of practice to reduce hazards and risks
within the Organization.

The Organization operates a confidential internal reporting system to allow personnel
to report hazard and risk issues that may warrant further attention. Personnel may
anonymously report hazards using the Safety Occurrence Report form in section 2.18.8
of this Exposition, completing any fields necessary to describe the hazard or risk. This
reporting system facilitates the collection of event data to assist in the identification of
the “root causes” so that appropriate mitigating actions (e.g. training, new procedures)
can be implemented.

No Reprisal Policy


To ensure compliance with the Organizations Safety and Quality Policy detailed in
section 1.2 of this Exposition, there will be no discrimination against any employee who
reports unsafe conditions or hazards. Indeed, personnel are encouraged and required
to do so.

**2.18.10 Description of Process to Report Occurrences**


Personnel are required to immediately report any hazard or risk that they discover in
the work place to the Maintenance Manager or the Quality Manager if an anonymous
report is required. The Safety Occurrence Report Form is provided for this purpose,
see section 2.18.8

_(c) 2_

**2.21.1 Information Retrieval**


Operator’s Data

Most of the Organizations’ customers have contracted the maintenance and control of
their aircraft’s status to third party companies specialized on computerized
maintenance tracking such as CAMP.

This responsibility for information retrieval lies with the customer together with their
contracted maintenance tracking companies.

An operator may wish to give the Company direct access to his maintenance data. This
is generally through electronic access. This access may be limited in time and/or to
“read only” or “read and update” access. The operator must give his instructions in
writing to these companies before they will allow the Organization access to the data
of their aircraft.

Organization’s Computerized records

No software programmes are currently used by the Organization, all work-packs are
scanned on completion on to the maintenance computer.

**2.22.2 Backup Systems**


The Maintenance Manager will back up records data on a regular basis and stored as
detailed in section 2.14.6 of this Exposition.

**2.22.3 Security and Safeguards to Unauthorized Access**


Access to the scanned maintenance records on the computer is via password. As the
records are scanned copies it is not possible to change a scanned image.

**2.22.1 Management System of Organization Planning Versus Time Available**


A continuous review of any provided owner / operators aircraft fleet maintenance
forecasts is carried out and reviewed against available manpower resources. Where
actual staff availability is less than required, discussions are held with the Owner /
operator to reschedule the maintenance inputs to ensure sufficient manpower is
available. Use may also be made of contract B1 or B2 support staff.

Unplanned line maintenance such as defect rectification is only accepted when
sufficient and appropriate manpower is available.

**2.22.2 Type of Planning**


Due to the ad-hoc nature of the work performed by the Organization a formal manhours plan against planned work is not possible.

**2.22.3 Types of Factors Taken into Account in the Planning**

Human Performance Limitations


The Maintenance Manager shall make every effort to minimise human performance
limitation risks when scheduling maintenance work inputs by the following mitigating
actions:

|Limitation|Mitigating Action|
|---|---|
|Fatigue|Adequate maintenance input periods, complex tasks not<br>performed at end of shift, awareness of staff health, circadian<br>rhythms|
|Stressors|Adequate planning, additional staff as required, minimum<br>interruptions, availability of required tools and equipment|
|Experience|Use of appropriately trained personnel|
|Environmental|Adequate lighting, heating, minimum noise, space|
|Communication|Clear and concise instructions, communications not rushed|
|Safety Awareness|Maximum information, interpretation of data, adequate checks,<br>situational awareness|
|Personalities and<br>Attitudes|Complementary maintenance teams, personal development|



Complexity of Work

Where the planned maintenance task involves work in numerous areas of the aircraft,
such as a scheduled maintenance inspection, the Maintenance Manager shall take the
following factors into account during the planning process:


|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCEORGANISATION EXPOSITION|Ref:|AXJS/145/MOE|
|---|---|---|---|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE ORGANISATION EXPOSITION|Issue/Amdt:|3 / 3|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Page:|2.58|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Date:|05 Oct 17|




    Sufficient downtime has been allowed by the operator

    Sufficient manpower is available to ensure continuity of maintenance and
inspection responsibility

    - Appropriate certifying and support staff are available when required to ensure
planned release to service dates can be met

    Contracted work such as NDI tasks are planned to integrate with critical path

progress


Additional Factors

The Maintenance Manager shall be aware of additional factors during the input
planning process that may affect allocated downtime or the ability of the Organization
to complete the tasks. These include but are not limited to:

    - Aircraft arrival and departure slots

    - Availability of spares

    - Time required for component servicing at subcontractors

    - Incoming fuel loading if tank access is required

    Safety considerations if working at height or in confined spaces

    - Availability of hangar space

    - Availability of ramp space for engine runs etc.

    - Unavailability of staff due to holiday, training etc.

**2.22.4 Planning Revision Process**


In the event that the operator requests a revision to the planned input, a revised work
order shall be requested from the operator. The Maintenance Manager shall review the
revised work order and assess whether the previously planned input is still achievable.
Any concerns shall be discussed with the operator.

**2.22.5 Organisation of Shifts**

At this time, the Organization does not operate a shift system.

**2.22.6 Notification to the Accountable Manager of Deviations Exceeding 25% Between**

**the Work Load and the Man Hour Availability**


Where the planned workload varies in excess of 25% of the available man-hours during
a calendar month the Accountable Manager shall be made aware. A decision will be
made by the Accountable Manager and Maintenance Manager to use contracted staff
or to revise the floor-loading plan for the duration of the exceedance.


The Accountable Manager and Maintenance Manager shall be aware of the AMC
145.A.30 (d) requirement which states that at least half of the staff that perform
maintenance should be employed by the Organization. When this requirement cannot
be met for a specific operational necessity, the Maintenance Manager shall contact the
CAA to request a temporary increase. This request shall include the reason for the
request and the additional safety precautions being taken to ensure adequate
Organization stability.

**2.23 CONTROL OF CRITICAL TASKS**


_Part 145.A.48 (c) / AMC4 145.A.48(b) - Part 145.A.65 (b) 3 / AMC 145.A.65 (b) 3 - Part_
_145.A.70 (a) 12 (b)_

**2.23.1 Critical Task Procedure and Control**


Where a maintenance task involves some element of disassembly / re-assembly of
several aircraft components of the same type fitted to more than one system of the
same aircraft, wherever possible, the tasks shall not be carried out by the same person.
The purpose of this requirement is to minimise a maintenance error being repeated on
identical aircraft components thereby compromising more than one aircraft system.

Where only one person is available to carry out and certify these tasks then that person
shall perform a separate re-inspection after task completion of all the same tasks. An
entry on the work card stating “CRITICAL TASK INSPECTION” shall be entered and
certified.

Where the integrity of a critical task can be verified by a subsequent check or
independent inspection, i.e. an engine run to check for leaks or inspection by a person
described in section 2.23.3 of this Exposition, then the critical task inspection
requirement can be waived.

**2.23.2 Critical Task List**

A critical task includes but is not limited to the following:


    - Inspection of chip detectors on multi-engine aircraft

    S.O.A.P. checks on multi-engine aircraft

    - Refitting of oil filler caps on multi-engine aircraft

    - Refitting of more than one wheel and tyre assemblies on an axle and/or brake units

    - Refitting of crew seats

**2.23.3 Independent Inspection Procedure**


An independent inspection shall be carried out after any flight safety sensitive
maintenance task has been carried out.

The manufactures instructions for continued airworthiness should be followed when
determining the need for an independent inspection.


In the absence of maintenance and inspection standards published by organisation
responsible for the type design, maintenance tasks that involve the assembly or any
disturbance of a control system that, if errors occurred, could result in a failure,
malfunction, or defect endangering the safe operation of the aircraft should be
considered as flight safety sensitive maintenance tasks needing an independent
inspection. A control system is an aircraft system by which the flight path, attitude, or
propulsive force of the aircraft is changed, including the flight, engine and propeller
controls, the related system controls and the associated operating mechanisms.

2.23.3.1Definitions

_Independent Inspection_    - is an inspection performed by an ‘independent qualified
person’ of a task carried out by an ‘authorised person’.

_Authorised Person_    - is the person who performs the task or supervises the task and
they assume the full responsibility for the completion of the task in accordance with
the applicable maintenance data. The authorised person issues the certificate of
release to service or signs off the completion of the task after the independent
inspection has been carried out satisfactorily

_Independent Qualified Person_    - is the person who performs the independent
inspection and attests the satisfactory completion of the task and that no deficiencies
have been found. The ‘independent qualified person’ does not issue a certificate of
release to service, therefore they are not required to hold certification privileges;

2.23.3.2 Work Card Recording of Independent Inspection

The authorised person requiring an independent check of work they have carried out
shall check () the Independent Check Box on work card (MF013). On completion
of the independent check both the authorised person and the independent
qualified person shall record their identification in the designated box of MF013
before the certificate of release to service or sign-off for the completion of the task is
issued.

2.23.3.3 Qualifications of persons performing independent inspections

The ‘independent qualified person’ shall be:


a. Staff holding a certifying staff or support staff or sign-off authorisation or equivalent

necessary to release or sign off the critical maintenance task; or

b. Staff holding a certifying staff or support staff or sign-off authorisation or equivalent

necessary to release or sign off similar task in a product of similar category and
having received specific practical training in the task to be inspected; or

c. An aircraft commander holding a limited certification authorisation in accordance

with 145.A.30(j)(4) and having received adequate practical training and having
enough experience in the specific task to be inspected and on how to perform
independent inspection. This qualification shall be subject to acceptance by the
Quality Manager.

2.23.3.4 How to perform an independent inspection

An independent inspection should ensure correct assembly, locking and sense of
operation. When inspecting control systems that have undergone maintenance, the
independent qualified person should consider the following points independently:


|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCEORGANISATION EXPOSITION|Ref:|AXJS/145/MOE|
|---|---|---|---|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE ORGANISATION EXPOSITION|Issue/Amdt:|3 / 5.2|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Page:|2.61|
|JET SUPPORT|MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES|Date:|12 Nov 18|



a. all those parts of the system that have actually been disconnected or disturbed

should be inspected for correct assembly and locking;
b. the system as a whole should be inspected for full and free movement over the

complete range;
c. cables should be tensioned correctly with adequate clearance at secondary

stops;
d. the operation of the control system as a whole should be observed to ensure

that the controls are operating in the correct sense;
e. if different control systems are interconnected so that they affect each other, all

the interactions should be checked through the full range of the applicable
controls; and
f. software that is part of the critical maintenance task should be checked, for
example: version, compatibility with aircraft configuration.

2.23.3.5 Reinspection Procedure


Reinspection, as an error-capturing method, should only be performed in unforeseen
circumstances when only one person is available to carry out the task and perform
the independent inspection. The circumstances cannot be considered unforeseen if
the person or organisation has not assigned a suitable ‘independent qualified person’
to that particular line station or shift.

Reinspection is an error-capturing method subject to the same conditions as an
independent inspection is, except that the ‘authorised person’ performing the
maintenance task is also acting as ‘independent qualified person’ and performs the
inspection.


The certificate of release to service is issued after the task has been performed by
the ‘authorised person’ and the reinspection has been carried out satisfactorily. The
work card (MF013) shall record the identification and the details of the reinspection
before the certificate of release to service for the task is issued.

**3.1.1 Definition of the Quality System**


Independence

The Quality Manager operates independently of all maintenance functions.

Access to the Accountable Manager

The Quality Manager reports directly to the Accountable Manager.

Composition and Function of Management Quality Group

The Organisation will carry out a systematic review of procedures and activities to
determine compliance with Part 145 in an efficient and effective manner. This review,
or audit, performed by the Quality Manager, will provide confidence of compliance to
the Accountable Manager and the Authority.

Due to the size of the Organization, the Management Quality Group consists of the
Quality Manager only.

**3.1.2 Company Audit Policy Including Compliance Audit**


Scheduled Audits and Random Audits

The Quality Manager will perform scheduled audits that assess the Organizations
compliance with Part 145 and this Exposition. Where a national rules also applies this
shall be included in the audit programme.

Unscheduled audits shall also be carried out as product audits.

Audit Notification

The Quality Manager will contact the Maintenance Manager by email to arrange an
audit visit to the facility, both for compliance audits and product audits. One audit per
year will be unannounced.

Audit Reports

Audits are recorded on form QF 004. This form is a combination checklist and narrative
of findings. Any non-compliance reports are recorded on form QF 030.

_Part 145.A.65 (a) - Part 145.A.65 (c) (1), (2) / AMC 145.A.65 (c) (1)_

Principals of Annual Audit Planning

The quality audit plan is specific to Part 145 and details those areas to be audited in a
12 month period. This plan represents the minimum acceptable level of audit functions.

Independence of the Auditors


Personnel performing audits shall be independent of the maintenance function that is
being audited.

Audits During the Performance of Work


Product audits shall be carried out on an unscheduled basis. A product audit shall
include all of the processes from initial receipt of an operator’s work order through to
release to service, including but not limited to personnel approvals, retention of
maintenance records and acceptance of parts etc.

Grouping of Audits

The scheduled audit of the Organization’s compliance with Part 145 and this Exposition
is grouped into two audits, one occurring in March and the other in September.

**3.1.4 Audit Programme**

Quality Audit Procedures


Quality Assurance embraces elements of auditing and verification. The audit function
must help to confirm that the Organizations procedures remain relevant to the Part 145
Organization and are effective in maintaining standards required by Part 145. This is
performed through a sampling programme and verification check to prove that
established procedures are followed during observed events and that the required
standard is achieved.


The audit and verification processes must examine all the functional activities of the
maintenance organisation to ensure compliance with the requirements of Part 145 and
the Authority. Furthermore, random verification of compliance with procedures must
cover all shifts (if operated) of the maintenance organisation.

The primary objective of the quality system should be to ensure that aircraft and aircraft
components are maintained in an airworthy condition and can be safely operated.
Other issues such as Health and Safety and Environmental must not detract from the
primary objective.

**3.2** **QUALITY AUDIT OF AIRCRAFT (and/or equipment)**

_Part 145.A.65 (c) (1), (2) / AMC 145.A.65 (c) (1)_

**3.2.1 Company Audit Policy**


It is important that the auditor is fair in his assessment when audits are carried out.
Results must be accurately recorded. Discrepancies found but not reported will cause
complete failure of the audit programme.

The auditor must observe what takes place, ask appropriate questions and verify the
answers. Auditors must verify by objective evidence the existence, adequacy and
application of documented procedures and standards to satisfy the requirements of this
Exposition, Part 145 and the Authority.

When conducting audits using a Quality Audit checklist, then these requirements are
to be regarded as the minimum level of investigation. It is the responsibility of the
auditor to verify the accuracy of any references on the Quality Audit Record Sheet as
a change in a particular reference may necessitate a change to the audit procedure.


All discrepancies found during an audit must be recorded as detailed in section 3.3 of
this Exposition.

**3.2.2 Audit Programme**

The audit programme is as detailed in section 3.1.4 of this Exposition.


Unplanned audits may be carried out to monitor maintenance standards. These will
include the witnessing of any relevant testing and visual inspection of components after
maintenance has been completed. The audit should not involve repeat disassembly or
testing unless the sample audit identifies findings requiring such action.

Audits must include but not be limited to an examination of all maintenance practices
and documentation, including procedures, inspections, training, process controls and
certifications performed in each area.

**3.2.3 Auditing Method**


Sampling

Quality audits of aircraft, including line maintenance, are carried out by the Quality
Manager in accordance with the audit plan in this Exposition.

The objective of the quality audit of aircraft is to ensure that through highly visible
frequent visits to the work area, aircraft and aircraft components are verified to be
maintained in an airworthy condition and operated safely and released to service in
accordance with this Exposition and Part 145.

**3.3** **QUALITY AUDIT CORRECTIVE ACTION PROCEDURE**

_Part 145.A.65 (c) (2) / AMC 145.A.65 (c) (2)_

**3.3.1 Description of the Quality Audit Report Feedback System**


Quality audit data is discussed during general meetings between the Accountable
Manager, Maintenance Manager and Quality Manager.

Non compliance reports are discussed with the Maintenance Manager to ensure the
discrepancies are understood and an acceptable response timescale agreed.

**3.3.2 Corrective Action and Timescale**


Corrective Action Planning and Follow Up

The quality audit remedial action procedure shall ensure that corrective action is
accomplished in a timely manner.


Where an audit is found to be unsatisfactory, the Quality Manager will request the
Maintenance Manager to instigate the necessary corrective action. If this can be
carried out during the audit, details of the action taken are recorded and accepted on
the audit check form.

If the deficiency is of a more serious nature and cannot be rectified immediately, the
deficiency will be recorded on Form QF 030 Non Compliance Report which will detailed
the required response time.

The Quality Manager maintains an awareness of the response times for non-conformity
reports to ensure they are answered on time.

Corrective Actions

Form QF 030 requires that the Maintenance Manager details the root cause, corrective
action and preventative action for each identified non conformity.


When assessing the root cause of a non conformity the Maintenance Manager will, as
required, utilise a decision making process based upon an in-depth understanding of
the processes and conditions where the non conformity occurred using the 5 Whys
technique.

The 5 Whys technique is most effective when the answers come from people who
had hands-on experience of the non conformity being examined to determine the true
root cause(s). When a non conformity has occurred, its nature and source shall be
determined by asking "why" no fewer than five times.

This method of response will try to ensure the non conformity is not repeated and a
continuous improvement of compliance is maintained.

|JET SUPPORT|QUALITY SYSTEM PROCEDURES|Date:|05 Oct 17|



Procedure for Extension to Response Periodicity for a Non Compliance Report

When a response to a non compliance report has not been received by the allocated
date the Quality Manager shall inform the Accountable Manager, who will instruct the
Maintenance Manager to respond with no further delay.

Where a satisfactory timely response to a non conformity report cannot be provided by
the Maintenance Manager due to factors outside his control, a written request shall be
made to the Quality Manager for an extension to the response time. This request must
provide full details of the reasons for a late response and a revised timescale for when
the response shall be provided. The Quality Manager shall review this information and
advise the Maintenance Manager of his decision whether to allow the delay or
otherwise.

The Quality Manager will annotate his records with any late responses or requests for
extensions to non compliance report periods.

**3.2.3 Quality Audit and Feedback Records Retention**

The Organization shall retain non compliance report records for 2 years. Non
compliance reports are retained in the main office facility.

**3.2.4 Review of the Quality System Overall Results**


Meeting with the Accountable Manager

The Quality Manager shall prepare an annual report for the Accountable Manager. The
report shall detail the status of the audit programme, results of audits, non conformity
reports including any variations to the response times and recommendations for
improvements.

The Accountable Manager, Quality Manager and other management personnel shall
review this report and agree on any actions required. Minutes of this review meeting
shall be retained by the Quality Manager.

Regular Meetings to check the progress of Corrective Actions


The Maintenance Manager and Quality Manager shall maintain regular communication
to ensure timely responses to non conformity reports. Due to the size of the
Organization this may be via email, telephone or by face to face contact.
