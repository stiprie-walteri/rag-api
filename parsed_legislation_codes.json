When defects are identified during maintenance, such information should be brought to the attention of the aircraft owner / operator who, dependent upon the procedural authority granted by the Authority of the state of registry, may determine that some defects can be deferred. The certificate of release to service must identify the defects not rectified and specify the owner / operators authority for such action.

A **Hazard** is defined as any condition, event, or circumstance which could induce an accident. **Risk** is a combination of the likelihood of a hazard occurring and the severity of the accident that could result; e.g. the higher the risk, the more likely the accident will occur and/or the more severe will be the consequence A Code of Practice The following procedures represent the code of practice to reduce hazards and risks within the Organization. The Organization operates a confidential internal reporting system to allow personnel to report hazard and risk issues that may warrant further attention. Personnel may anonymously report hazards using the Safety Occurrence Report form in section 2.18.8 of this Exposition, completing any fields necessary to describe the hazard or risk. This reporting system facilitates the collection of event data to assist in the identification of the “root causes” so that appropriate mitigating actions (e.g. training, new procedures) can be implemented. No Reprisal Policy To ensure compliance with the Organizations Safety and Quality Policy detailed in section 1.2 of this Exposition, there will be no discrimination against any employee who reports unsafe conditions or hazards.

This is performed through a sampling programme and verification check to prove that established procedures are followed during observed events and that the required standard is achieved. The audit and verification processes must examine all the functional activities of the maintenance organisation to ensure compliance with the requirements of Part 145 and the Authority. Furthermore, random verification of compliance with procedures must cover all shifts (if operated) of the maintenance organisation. The primary objective of the quality system should be to ensure that aircraft and aircraft components are maintained in an airworthy condition and can be safely operated. Other issues such as Health and Safety and Environmental must not detract from the primary objective."

The Quality Manager maintains an awareness of the response times for non-conformity reports to ensure they are answered on time. Corrective Actions Form QF 030 requires that the Maintenance Manager details the root cause, corrective action and preventative action for each identified non conformity. When assessing the root cause of a non conformity the Maintenance Manager will, as required, utilise a decision making process based upon an in-depth understanding of the processes and conditions where the non conformity occurred using the 5 Whys technique. The 5 Whys technique is most effective when the answers come from people who had hands-on experience of the non conformity being examined to determine the true root cause(s). When a non conformity has occurred, its nature and source shall be determined by asking \"why\" no fewer than five times.
